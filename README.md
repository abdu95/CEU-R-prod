## Syllabus

Please find in the `syllabus` folder of this repository.

## Technical Prerequisites

1. You need a laptop with any operating system and stable Internet connection.
2. Please make sure that network firewall rules are not limiting your access to unusual ports (e.g. 22, 8787, 8080, 8000), as we will heavily use these in the class (can be a problem on a company network).
3. Please install Slack, and join the #ï»¿ba-de5-2020 channel in the `ceu-bizanalytics` group.
4. Highly suggested to get a second monitor where you can follow the online stream, and keep your main monitor for your own work. The second monitor could be an external screen attached to your laptop, e.g. a TV, monitor, projector, but if you don't have access to one, you may also use a table or phone to dial-in to the Zoom call.

## Class Schedule

Will be updated from week to week.

## Week 1: Using R in the Cloud

**Goal**: learn how to run and schedule R jobs in the cloud.

### Background: Example use-cases and why to use R in the cloud?

### Welcome to AWS!

1. Use the central CEU AWS account: https://ceu.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
2. Secure your access key(s), other credentials and any login information ...

    > "When I woke up the next morning, I had four emails and a missed phone call from Amazon AWS - something about 140 servers running on my AWS account, mining Bitcoin"
    -- [Hoffman said](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots)

    > "Nevertheless, now I know that Bitcoin can be mined with SQL, which is priceless ;-)"
    -- [Uri Shaked](https://medium.com/@urish/thank-you-google-how-to-mine-bitcoin-on-googles-bigquery-1c8e17b04e62)

    So set up 2FA (go to IAM / Users / username / Security credentials / Assigned MFA device): https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam

    PS probably you do not really need to store any access keys, but you may rely on roles (and the Key Management Service, and the Secrets Manager and so on)
    </details>

3. Let's use the `eu-west-1` Ireland region

### Getting access to EC2 boxes

**Note**: we follow the instructions on Windows in the Computer Lab, but please find below how to access the boxes from Mac or Linux as well when working with the instances remotely.

1. Create (or import) an SSH key in AWS (EC2 / Key Pairs): https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#KeyPairs:sort=keyName
2. Get an SSH client:

    * Windows -- Download and install PuTTY: https://www.putty.org
    * Mac -- Install PuTTY for Mac using homebrew or macports

        ```sh
        sudo brew install putty
        sudo port install putty
        ```

    * Linux -- probably the OpenSSH client is already installed, but to use the same tools on all operating systems, please install and use PuTTY on Linux too, eg on Ubuntu:

        ```sh
        sudo apt install putty
        ```

3. ~~Convert the generated pem key to PuTTY format~~No need to do this anymore, AWS can provide the key as PPK now.

    * GUI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html#putty-private-key
    * CLI:

        ```sh
        puttygen key.pem -O private -o key.ppk
        ```

4. Make sure the key is readable only by your Windows/Linux/Mac user, eg

    ```sh
    chmod 0400 key.ppk
    ```

### Create and connect to an EC2 box

1. Create a tiny EC2 instance

    0. Optional: create an Elastic IP for your box
    1. Go the the Instances overview at https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Instances:sort=instanceId
    2. Click "Launch Instance"
    3. Pick the `Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type` AMI
    4. Pick `t3.micro` instance type (see more [instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types))
    5. Click "Review and Launch"
    6. Pick a unique name for the security group after clicking "Edit Security Group"
    7. Click "Launch"
    8. Select your AWS key created above and launch

2. Connect to the box

    1. Specify the hostname or IP address

    ![](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/vmlaunch/images/vm-putty-1.png)

    2. Specify the key for authentication

    ![](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/vmlaunch/images/vm-putty-2.png)

    3. Set the username to `ubuntu` on the Connection/Data tab
    4. Save the Session profile
    5. Click the "Open" button
    6. Accept & cache server's host key

Alternatively, you can connect via a standard SSH client on a Mac or Linux, something like:

```sh
chmod 0400 /path/to/your/pem
ssh -i /path/to/your/pem -p 8000 ubuntu@ip-address-of-your-machine
```
